You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.

//Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
5 Possible Components: 
App 
    NavBar 
    ZooAnimalPage
        ZooAnimalForm 
        ZooAnimalList
            ZooAnimalCard

//There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router
3 Client Routers: 
    Home 
    PetList
    Pet form submission 

Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.

Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. 

Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

//External API: https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com/

You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.

Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled components or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Material UI) if you prefer.
